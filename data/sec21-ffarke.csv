So seeing some of my previous search results that I couldnt quite recall but could tell it was a throw away search be somewhat 'permanently' attached to my profile just feels... strange.

I get a kick out of one of them that has me compare 20 news stories from Google to 20 news stories from Facebook because they always ask whether I prefer Google or Facebook news.   When I say Google they ask why and I tell them it is because Google quite literally tracks me around the web on all of my devices day and night.  This means that Google has a very good understanding of what does and does not interest me and will often bring to my attention things that I would not have been likely to run across on my own.
